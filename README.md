# Huffman-Coding-Visualizer

This application is built using TypeScript and React, with Tailwind CSS for styling. Here are the key features and functions:

Core Algorithm Implementation: Character frequency calculation Huffman tree construction Binary code generation Text encoding and decoding Compression ratio calculation Interactive Components: Text input area for entering content to encode Real-time visualization of the Huffman binary tree Dynamic encoding table showing character frequencies and codes Bit savings display showing compression statistics Copy-to-clipboard functionality for encoded binary Visual Elements: Color-coded tree nodes (purple for root, blue for internal nodes, green for leaf nodes) Interactive binary tree visualization with labeled edges (0 for left, 1 for right) Progress bar showing compression percentage Validation indicators for successful encoding/decoding Key Functions: calculateFrequency(): Counts occurrence of each character in input text

const frequency = calculateFrequency("hello"); // Returns: { h: 1, e: 1, l: 2, o: 1 } buildHuffmanTree(): Creates binary tree based on character frequencies

Combines lowest frequency nodes Builds tree bottom-up Assigns weights to internal nodes generateCodes(): Creates binary codes for each character

Traverses tree from root to leaves Assigns 0 for left branches, 1 for right Ensures prefix-free codes encodeText(): Converts input text to binary using generated codes

const encoded = encode decodeText(): Converts binary back to original text using tree

Traverses tree following binary path Reconstructs original characters calculateBitSavings(): Compares original vs compressed sizes

Original: 8 bits per character (ASCII) Compressed: Variable-length Huffman codes Shows percentage saved The app demonstrates the greedy nature of Huffman coding by:

Always combining lowest frequency nodes first Assigning shorter codes to frequent characters Building an optimal prefix code tree Achieving efficient compression without loss of data All components update in real-time as the user types, providing immediate visual feedback about the compression process.
